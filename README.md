Console based generalized location visualizer ðŸ‘€

## motivation

I was looking for one fully console based location data visualiser, with below functionalities 

- can show machine's connected peers
- can look up given IP Address location
- can look up given (sub-)domain name location
- can show peers, given torrent ðŸ§² link
- _can show my own location on Map_

But couldn't find one, may be I needed to try harder. 

So I decided to write one, with all these above mentioned functionalites.

I'll interested in extending its functionalites in future days, if you find I'm missing certain use case, feel free to let me know/ just raise a PR.
