## motivation

I was looking for one fully console based geo location data visualiser, with below functionalities 

- can geo locate machine's connected TCP/ UDP peers üë©‚Äçüíª
- can geo locate any IP Address
- can geo locate all IPv{4,6} addresses, resolvable from (sub-)domain name
- can geo locate peers, given torrent üß≤ link
- _can show my own location on Map_ üôã

which can be used in fully console based environments i.e. ssh-ing into VM, VPS etc.

But couldn't find one, may be I required to try harder. So I decided to write one, with all these above mentioned functionalites.

I interested in extending its functionalites in coming days, if you find I'm missing certain use case, feel free to let me know/ just raise a PR.

## features

- Given (sub-)domain name, it can look up all associated server IPv4/6 addresses, showing them in console map ü•¥
- Given IPv4/6 address, can lookup it's location & show it in console map ü•≥
- Can find all active TCP/UDP socket connections & marks their respective peers in console map ü§©
- Given torrent üß≤ link, can look up all peers associated with that infohash & show them in console map ü§ì
- Given any random URL, parses HTML & extracts out all static content i.e. {`*.js`, `*.css`, `image/*`} delivery domains & geo locate them üòé

In all these cases, generates a tabular report of all connected peers _( including self )_, who were shown on console map

## prerequisite

We need to download [IP2Location‚Ñ¢ LITE IP-COUNTRY-REGION-CITY-LATITUDE-LONGITUDE Database](https://lite.ip2location.com/database/ip-country-region-city-latitude-longitude) for using this tool.

Consider using IPv6 Binary version, cause that will also support IPv4 lookup. This specific database I've planned to use is codenamed **db5**.

Please try to stick with that, otherwise there might be some unexpected behaviours.

And we need to have NodeJS( >10.X ).

## installation

### using NPM

This [software](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lenz) is distributed using NPM.

```bash
npm i -g lenz
```

### using GITHUB

You can clone this repo in your machine and run below commands to use this CLI tool.

Lets get into project directory

```bash
git clone git@github.com:itzmeanjan/lenz.git
cd lenz/lenz
npm install # installing all dependencies
```

And install tool globally. Also make sure you've added NPM global installation path to your system **PATH** variable.

```bash
npm i -g .
```

Now you can use `lenz` from any where in your directory tree.

### Locate static content delivery domains used in a webpage ( lr )

Given any webpage URL, parses out its `script`, `link` & `img` tags, which are used for including static resources into HTML i.e. CSS, JS & images. If they are delivered from some domain other than this one, extract them out & then resolve those domain names into IPv4/6 addresses, which are to be geolocated using IP2Location DB5 database. They are also shown on console map.

For using this command we need two IP2Location database

- [IP2Location‚Ñ¢ LITE IP-COUNTRY-REGION-CITY-LATITUDE-LONGITUDE Database](https://lite.ip2location.com/database/ip-country-region-city-latitude-longitude)
- [IP2Location‚Ñ¢ LITE IP-ASN Database](https://lite.ip2location.com/database/ip-asn)
