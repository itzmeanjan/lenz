# lenz ü§ì

Console based MAP üó∫ : only **11.2 kB** of unpacked size.

![sc](sc/sc_0.gif)

## motivation

I was looking for one fully console based location data visualiser, with below functionalities 

- can show machine's connected peers üë©‚Äçüíª
- can look up given IP Address location
- can look up given (sub-)domain name location
- can show peers, given torrent üß≤ link
- _can show my own location on Map_ üôã

which can be invoked in fully console based environments i.e. VM, VPS etc.

But couldn't find one, may be I required to try harder. 

So I decided to write one, with all these above mentioned functionalites.

I interested in extending its functionalites in coming days, if you find I'm missing certain use case, feel free to let me know/ just raise a PR.

## features

- Given (sub-)domain name, it can look up all associated server IPv4/6 addresses, showing them in console map ü•¥
- Given IPv4/6 address, can lookup it's location & show it in console map ü•≥
- Can find all active TCP/UDP socket connections & marks their respective peers in console map ü§©
- Given torrent üß≤ link, can look up all peers associated with that infohash & show them in console map ü§ì

_In all these cases, generates a tabular report of all connected peers _( including self )_, who were shown on console map_

## prerequisite

We need to download [IP2Location‚Ñ¢ LITE IP-COUNTRY-REGION-CITY-LATITUDE-LONGITUDE Database](https://lite.ip2location.com/database/ip-country-region-city-latitude-longitude) for using this tool.

Consider using IPv6 Binary version, cause that will also support IPv4 lookup. This specific database I've planned to use is codenamed **db5**.

Please try to stick with that, otherwise there might be some unexpected behaviours.

And we need to have NodeJS( >10.X ).

## installation

### using NPM

[This](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lenz) software is distributed using NPM.

```bash
npm i -g lenz
```

### using GITHUB

You can clone this repo in your machine and run below commands to use this CLI tool.

Lets get into project directory

```bash
git clone git@github.com:itzmeanjan/lenz.git
cd lenz/lenz
npm install # installing all dependencies
```

And install tool globally. Also make sure you've added NPM global installation path to your system **PATH** variable.

```bash
npm i -g .
```

Now you can use `lenz` from any where in your directory tree.

## usage

Invoke `lenz` from CLI, supplying proper params for each of supported commands.

> ‚ùå : Your location, using IP address

> ‚≠ïÔ∏è : Peer(s) location
